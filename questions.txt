1.  <stdint.h> is a header to declare sets of integer types having specified widths.
2.  unit8_t, unit16_t and unit32_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 8, 16 and 32 bits respectively.
    int32_t denotes signed inteher type with a width of exactly 32 bits.
3.  BYTE = 1 byte (8 bits)
    DWORD = 4 bytes (32 bits)
    LONG = 4 bytes (32 bits)
    WORD = 2 bytes (16 bits)
4.  In ASCII, the first two bytes are the characters BM.
    In decimal, 16973
    In Hexadecimal, 0x424d
5.  bfsize specifies the size of whole bitmap file.
    bisize specifies the size of a BITMAPINFOHEADER structure.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap has its rows stored in top-down order with the origin at upper left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  If there is no free space in the file system or user does not authorize to create a file or if it can't find the file.
9.  The third argument of fread specifies number of reads from a stream and we need only one read of a structure at a time.
10. It specifies 3 bytes of padding
11. It moves to a specific location in a file
12. SEEK_CUR is an argument to fseek(). It means seek from the current location.
